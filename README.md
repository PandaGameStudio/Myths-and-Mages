# Myths-and-Mages
Our new game project Myths & Mages (working title)

Myths and Mages is a fantasy dating sim / rpg with roguelike elements.

The player seeks to romance 10 characters in order to utilise their powers to get further through the dungeon.

Don't forget a heaping plateful of dates and trauma bonding!

# Choose between 10 characters specialising in different fields of spellcasting to date

From water magic nymphs to astral magic elves,
You'll be hunting down all sorts of dateable archetypes!

Cool chicks, kissable thunks, bubbly girls, you name it!
There's someone for everyone here!
(unless there isn't.)


Get ready, mage-simps, for the dungeon dive of a lifetime!
